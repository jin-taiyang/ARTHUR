ARTHUR (Archaeology Research Through Historical Unpopular Resources) is my first try to create a Python project. 
It's the first complete project I upload on the GitHub. 
This project provide to users information about Historical events. 
These Historical events would be about Ancient or Modern History (Archaeology Research). 
These information is been mined by multiple sources, such as Wikipedia (Unpopular Resources).
